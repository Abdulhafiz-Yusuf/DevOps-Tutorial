# Linux Basic Commands - chmod and chown

This section provides an in-depth explanation of the `chmod` and `chown` commands, including examples.

## chmod - Change File and Directory Permissions

### Symbolic Mode

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `u`      | User        |
| `g`      | Group       |
| `o`      | Others      |
| `a`      | All (User, Group, and Others) |

| Permission | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `r`        | Read        |
| `w`        | Write       |
| `x`        | Execute     |

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `+`    | Add permission |
| `-`    | Remove permission |
| `=`    | Set permission |

### Example

To add execute permission for the user:

### Example

To add execute permission for the user:

```
chmod u+x [file or directory]
```

To remove write permission for the group and others:

```
chmod go-w [file or directory]
```


To set read and execute permissions for the user, and read permission for the group and others:


```
chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r [file or directory]
```

## Octal Mode

| Octal Value | Permission          |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| `0`         | No permission       |
| `1`         | Execute             |
| `2`         | Write               |
| `3`         | Write and Execute   |
| `4`         | Read                |
| `5`         | Read and Execute    |
| `6`         | Read and Write      |
| `7`         | Read, Write, Execute|

### Example

To set read, write, and execute permissions for the user, read and write permissions for the group, and read permission for others:

```
chmod 764 [file or directory]
```


## chown - Change File and Directory Ownership

### Syntax

```
chown [owner]:[group] [file or directory]
```

### Example

To change the owner of a file or directory to `newuser` and the group to `newgroup`:

```
chown newuser:newgroup [file or directory]
```

To change only the owner to `newuser`:

```
chown newuser [file or directory]
```

To change only the group to `newgroup`:

```
chown :newgroup [file or directory]
```
## Additional Notes

- The `chmod` and `chown` commands can be used recursively with the `-R` option to change permissions or ownership for a directory and its contents:


```
chmod -R [permissions] [directory]
chown -R [owner]:[group] [directory]
```


- You can use the `umask` command to set default file permissions for newly created files:

```
umask [octal value]
```

- You can use the `id` command to display information about the current user and group:

```
id
```
For more information and examples, consult the `man` pages for each command:
```
man chmod
man chown
```
